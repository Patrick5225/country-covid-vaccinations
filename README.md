# About
This project is a data analytics consulting project that imitates data consulting work in a business environment. This project was not done alone; instead it was worked on with a team of 5 members. As a team, our goal is to deliver a business solution to a client by understanding and researching the client's problem that was given to our team and then coming up with a solution using analytical tools such as Excel, SQL, Tableau, and Python. The project experience involves solving problems, collecting external data, cleaning and analyzing data, meetings, research, deadlines, and presentations to present our findings to our client.

For this particular project, our client is a vaccine manufacturer distributor who needs help deciding which country to rollout their COVID-19 vaccinations to next, in a data-driven approach.

# Basic Overview
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a contagious disease that has affected millions of people across many countries worldwide. To combat this disease, COVID-19 vaccines have been created and distributed to people living in different countries. However, the vaccines are currently in limited supply, and hence not every country has immediate access to the vaccines. The **question** to be solved is, which country should receive the next rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations, in a data-driven approach? This approach involves analyzing country vaccination data that contains information about the daily and total amount of COVID-19 vaccinations for COVID-19 (as of March 2021).
